NoSQL Data Analysis on Indian Car Companies
In this project, I worked with a dataset containing specifications of cars from various Indian automobile companies. The dataset included details such as maker, model, fuel type, transmission, engine specifications, features, and safety attributes.

To efficiently manage and analyze this data, I designed a NoSQL database in MongoDB named "Automobiles", which consists of three collections:

Cars: Stores detailed specifications of different car models.
Orders: Maintains records of car purchases and customer orders.
Users: Contains user details, including preferences and purchase history.
By leveraging MongoDB's powerful querying capabilities, I performed complex analyses using various NoSQL functions, including:
✅ Aggregation Pipelines to extract meaningful insights.
✅ Indexing & Filtering for optimized data retrieval.
✅ Insert, Update, and Delete Operations to manage the database efficiently.
✅ Joins & Lookups to connect related data across collections.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in NoSQL database design, data retrieval techniques, and querying structured data using MongoDB, enhancing my understanding of real-world database management.
